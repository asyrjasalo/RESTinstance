# RESTinstance

[Robot Framework](http://robotframework.org) library for RESTful JSON APIs

[Keyword Documentation](https://asyrjasalo.github.io/RESTinstance)

## Advantages

1.  **RESTinstance relies on Robot Framework's language-agnostic, clean
    and minimal syntax, for API tests.** It is neither tied to any
    particular programming language nor development framework. Using
    RESTinstance requires little, if any, programming knowledge. It
    builts on long-term technologies with well established communities,
    such as HTTP, JSON (Schema), Swagger/OpenAPI and Robot Framework.
2.  **It validates JSON using JSON Schema, guiding you to write API
    tests to base on properties** rather than on specific values (e.g.
    "email must be valid" vs "email is foo@bar.com"). This approach
    reduces test maintenance when the values responded by the API are
    prone to change. Although values are not required, you can still
    test them whenever they make sense (e.g. GET response body from one
    endpoint, then POST some of its values to another endpoint and
    verify the results).
3.  **It generates JSON Schema for requests and responses automatically,
    and the schema gets more accurate by your tests.** Output the schema
    to a file and reuse it as expectations to test the other methods, as
    most of them respond similarly with only minor differences. Or
    extend the schema further to a full Swagger spec (version 2.0,
    OpenAPI 3.0 also planned), which RESTinstance can test requests and
    responses against. All this leads to reusability, getting great test
    coverage with minimum number of keystrokes and very clean tests.

## Installation

Install and upgrade [from PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/RESTinstance):

    pip install --upgrade RESTinstance

## Usage

See [the keyword documentation](https://asyrjasalo.github.io/RESTinstance).

### Quick start

1.  Create two new empty directories, `atest` and `results`.
2.  Create a new file `atest/YOURNAME.robot` with the content:

``` robotframework
*** Settings ***
Library         REST    https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
Documentation   Test data can be read from variables and files.
...             Both JSON and Python type systems are supported for inputs.
...             Every request creates a so-called instance. Can be `Output`.
...             Most keywords are effective only for the last instance.
...             Initial schemas are autogenerated for request and response.
...             You can make them more detailed by using assertion keywords.
...             The assertion keywords correspond to the JSON types.
...             They take in either path to the property or a JSONPath query.
...             Using (enum) values in tests optional. Only type is required.
...             All the JSON Schema validation keywords are also supported.
...             Thus, there is no need to write any own validation logic.
...             Not a long path from schemas to full Swagger/OpenAPI specs.
...             The persistence of the created instances is the test suite.
...             Use keyword `Rest instances` to output the created instances.


*** Variables ***
${json}         { "id": 11, "name": "Gil Alexander" }
&{dict}         name=Julie Langford


*** Test Cases ***
GET an existing user, notice how the schema gets more accurate
    GET         /users/1                  # this creates a new instance
    Output schema   response body
    Object      response body             # values are fully optional
    Integer     response body id          1
    String      response body name        Leanne Graham
    [Teardown]  Output schema             # note the updated response schema

GET existing users, use JSONPath for very short but powerful queries
    GET         /users?_limit=5           # further assertions are to this
    Array       response body
    Integer     $[0].id                   1           # first id is 1
    String      $[0]..lat                 -37.3159    # any matching child
    Integer     $..id                     maximum=5   # multiple matches
    [Teardown]  Output  $[*].email        # outputs all emails as an array

POST with valid params to create a new user, can be output to a file
    POST        /users                    ${json}
    Integer     response status           201
    [Teardown]  Output  response body     ${OUTPUTDIR}/new_user.demo.json

PUT with valid params to update the existing user, values matter here
    PUT         /users/2                  { "isCoding": true }
    Boolean     response body isCoding    true
    PUT         /users/2                  { "sleep": null }
    Null        response body sleep
    PUT         /users/2                  { "pockets": "", "money": 0.02 }
    String      response body pockets     ${EMPTY}
    Number      response body money       0.02
    Missing     response body moving      # fails if property moving exists

PATCH with valid params, reusing response properties as a new payload
    &{res}=     GET   /users/3
    String      $.name                    Clementine Bauch
    PATCH       /users/4                  { "name": "${res.body['name']}" }
    String      $.name                    Clementine Bauch
    PATCH       /users/5                  ${dict}
    String      $.name                    ${dict.name}

DELETE the existing successfully, save the history of all requests
    DELETE      /users/6                  # status can be any of the below
    Integer     response status           200    202     204
    Rest instances  ${OUTPUTDIR}/all.demo.json  # all the instances so far
```

3.  Make JSON API testing great again:
```
robot --outputdir results atest/
```

## Contributing

Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) if not already installed:

    python -m pip install --user pre-commit

Install pre-commit hooks in your working copy:

    pre-commit install

Kindly create an [issue](https://github.com/asyrjasalo/RESTinstance/issues)
and then create a pull request.

### Local development

You may use your favorite Python version manager (adsf, pyenv, ...) as long
as it follows `.python-version`.

Install [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/latest/):

    python -m pip install --user pdm

Install dependencies:

    pdm install

To run unit tests only:

    pdm test

Acceptance tests assume you have started [mountebank](https://www.mbtest.org)
`testapi/` on another terminal first:

    pdm testenv

Note that you can then debug mountebank requests and responses created by tests
at [localhost:2525](http://localhost:2525/imposters).

To run acceptance tests:

    pdm atest

Both scripts allow passing arguments to `pytest` and `robot`, respectively:

    pdm test -- test/<test_modulename>.py
    pdm atest -- atest/<atest_suitefile>.robot

To format source files in-place:

    pdm format

### Building a new version

Run both unit and acceptance tests:

    pdm tests

Recreate documentation:

    pdm docs

Build source dist and wheel:

    pdm build

### Releasing to PyPI

Pre-release to TestPyPI:

    pdm publish --no-build --repository testpypi

Release to PyPI:

    pdm publish --no-build

# RESTinstance

Robot Framework test library for (RESTful) JSON APIs


## Why?

1. **RESTinstance relies on [Robot Framework](http://robotframework.org/)'s language-agnostic, natural language syntax for API tests.**
It is not tied to any particular programming language
nor development framework.
Using RESTinstance requires little, if any, programming knowledge.
It builts on long-term technologies with well established communities,
such as HTTP, JSON (Schema), OpenAPI and Robot Framework.

2. **It validates JSON using JSON Schema, guiding you to write API tests
to base on constraints** rather than on specific values
(e.g. "email must be valid" vs "email is foo@bar.com").
This approach reduces test maintenance when the values responded by the API
are prone to change.
Although values are not required, you can still test whenever they make
sense (e.g. GET response body from one endpoint, then POST some of its values
to another endpoint).

3. **It generates JSON Schema for requests and responses automatically,
and the schema gets more accurate by you writing tests.**
The schema is a contract between different teams, or functions
(backend, frontend, partners), to agree on what kind of data the API handles.
Additionally, you can mark validations to be skipped and rather use
the tests to define how the API should work - then the schema also acts as a
design.
The schema can be further extended to an OpenAPI specification
(manually for now, generating also this is planned), which RESTinstance can also
test requests and responses against. This leads to very clean looking tests.


## Installation

### Python:

    pip install --upgrade RESTinstance

The package is hosted in [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RESTinstance).

### Using Docker

If you have Docker available, prefer
[rfdocker](https://github.com/asyrjasalo/rfdocker) and just add
`RESTinstance` to your `requirements.txt`.

Alternatively, a ready image is available at
[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/asyrjasalo/restinstance/).

## Usage

See [keyword documentation](https://github.com/asyrjasalo/RESTinstance/tree/master/docs/REST.html).

The most common use cases for RESTinstances are:

1. **Testing for JSON types and formats using JSON Schema validations.**
For examples, see `tests/validations.robot`.

2. **Flow-driven API tests, i.e. multiple APIs are called for the result.**
For examples, see `tests/methods.robot`.

3. **Testing API requests and responses against a schema or a specification.**
For examples testing against JSON schemas, see `tests/schema.robot`
and for testing against Swagger 2.0 specification, see `tests/spec.robot`.

(TODO: embed examples here)

## Development

The issues and requests are tracked in
[GitHub](https://github.com/asyrjasalo/RESTinstance/issues). We kindly do take
pull requests (please mention if you do not want to be listed as contributors).

### Running tests

Docker is mandatory for running the library's own tests:

    ./test

To run on python 2:

    BUILD_ARGS="-f Dockerfile.python2" ./test

### System under test

The test API is implemented by
[mounterest](https://github.com/asyrjasalo/mounterest),
which in turn builds on [mountebank](http://www.mbtest.org).

In the scope of library's tests, mounterest acts as a HTTP proxy to
[Typicode's live JSON server](jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) and uses
mountebank's injections to enrich responses slightly, so that they better
match to this library's testing needs. Particularly, it allows us to test
the library with non-safe HTTP methods (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
by mimicking their changes in the state only, instead of trying to issue
them on the live server. The state is cleared between the test runs.

for JSON Schema generation
- [Flex](https://github.com/pipermerriam/flex), by Piper Merriam,
for Swagger 2.0 validation
- [jsonschema](https://github.com/Julian/jsonschema), by Julian Berman,
for JSON Schema draft-04 validation
- [requests](https://github.com/requests/requests), by Kenneth Reitz,
for Python HTTP requests
